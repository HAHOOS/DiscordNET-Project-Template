# [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) Project Template
[Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) project template that includes an easy to use menu and easy configuration

This template has been made to make [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)'s developers life easier. It includes a menu with presets. Presets are made to easily switch between different bots - if you want to test a new feature, you can create a preset for it or if you just want to run the bot, create a preset with the main bot. There is an easy to use configuration system for presets which you can learn about in the wiki.

Once the bot is started, you have useful commands such as:
- lookup - Lookup info about a server the bot is in. It also gives you an invite link
- chat - Opens a menu where you can chat in servers as a bot through the terminal
- dm - Opens a menu where you can answer DMs from users
**And a lot more**
